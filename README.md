### Web3 BUIDL ARBITRUM DEVELOPER WORKSHOP `HO TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY GROUP TWO` 
### A Two day packed workshop to onboard newbies to web3 development by teaching them how to build  smart contracts , deploying and verifying onchain, and connecting the smart contract to a frontend 

#### This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized storage contract along with a frontend interface. Each team member has worked on their respective branches to contribute to the project


#### Each team member's README.md file includes their specific contract deployment address  and transaction hash
